/* this is our View Model; it brokers communication between the view and the model per the MVVM architecture.
 
 I think for a program of this complexity it's probably a bit overkill but there are a few bits of code here that you could argue
 shouldn't go in the view or the model.
 
 It's also good practice to get a handle on MVVM
