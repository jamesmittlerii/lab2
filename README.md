Description:-

This memory game is comprised of 12 randomly selected cards from a larger group and each card is duplacated into a random 6 x 4 array on the screen. Each card is covered by a blue rectangle. The user starts uncovering each card by clicking on 2 cards at a time. If the 2 cards are the same, they stay uncovered. If they are not the same, they are recovered and the user tries another 2 cards. This continues until all the cards are uncovered, at which point the Game History screen appears showing the latest game/date/time & # of taps
